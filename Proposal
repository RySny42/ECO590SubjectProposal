If Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.-Richard G. Wilkinson, Social Epidemiologist at The University of Nottingham

If a parent's income had no effect on a child's opportunity for future upward mobility, approximately 20% of poor children who started in the bottom quintile (in the bottom 20% of the US range of incomes) would remain there as poor adults. At the other end of income spectrum, if children were born into wealthy families in the top 20%, only 20% would stay in that top income category if their mobility opportunities were equal to every other child's in the country.

Education is believed to be the greatest equalizer and path to upward income mobility.

As the graph below reflects, without a college degree a child born into a family in the lowest quintile has a 45% chance of remaining in that quintile as an adult and only a 5% percent chance of moving into the highest quintile. The presentation is somewhat misleading and neglects to reflect that a child born into poverty has a 55% chance of moving into a higher quintile. Similarly, a child born into a family in the lowest quintile has a 19% chance of moving into the highest quintile upon earning a degree and a 16% chance of remaining in the lowest quintile. A college degree provides a 84% chance of upward mobility compared to the 55% chance without a degree.
