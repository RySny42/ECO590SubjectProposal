If Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.-Richard G. Wilkinson, Social Epidemiologist at The University of Nottingham

If a parent's income had no effect on a child's opportunity for future upward mobility, approximately 20% of poor children who started in the bottom quintile (in the bottom 20% of the US range of incomes) would remain there as poor adults. At the other end of income spectrum, if children were born into wealthy families in the top 20%, only 20% would stay in that top income category if their mobility opportunities were equal to every other child's in the country.

Compared to other Western countries, mobility in the United States is low with studies showing between a .4 to .6 relation.

Education is believed to be the greatest equalizer and path to upward income mobility.

As the graph below reflects, without a college degree a child born into a family in the lowest quintile has a 45% chance of remaining in that quintile as an adult and only a 5% percent chance of moving into the highest quintile. The presentation is somewhat misleading and neglects to reflect that a child born into poverty has a 55% chance of moving into a higher quintile. Similarly, a child born into a family in the lowest quintile has a 19% chance of moving into the highest quintile upon earning a degree and a 16% chance of remaining in the lowest quintile. A college degree provides a 84% chance of upward mobility compared to the 55% chance without a degree.

Based on interpretation, education does not appear to do much to even the playing field for children born into the lowest quintile. Additionally, relying on income to measure mobility is an inherent distortion that frames debate. Income is more fluid over time and one component of large disparities in intergenerational wealth.

This project proposes to examine mobility using variables for education, income and wealth across quintiles. Variables will be created using APIs from The United States Census Bureau (key below) and data sets from the Nation Center for Education Statistics.

I saved a snapshot of the website and request but am still learning how to add images. I have not succeeded the path to the file part yet because I am uncertain of the path.

My academic and professional interests include poverty and inequality, but my primary motivation for this project is to familiarize myself with Python and methods. I think it will be easier to narrow down the project as I learn more about the two. I will be content if I am able to present the material relatively well on GitHub.
