If Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.-Richard G. Wilkinson, Social Epidemiologist at The University of Nottingham

If a parent's income had no effect on a child's opportunity for future upward mobility, approximately 20% of poor children who started in the bottom quintile (in the bottom 20% of the US range of incomes) would remain there as poor adults. At the other end of income spectrum, if children were born into wealthy families in the top 20%, only 20% would stay in that top income category if their mobility opportunities were equal to every other child's in the country.

Compared to other Western countries, mobility in the United States is low with studies showing between a .4 to .6 relation.
